Plan

Restate
    Create a function that returns the Fibonacci number for the number that it takes as input.

Divide

Start with what you know   
    First 6 numbers of sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,

Reduce
    Create 3 variables. The variable with the lowest value should then be assigned the value of the sum of the other two variables. Could this be done in an array?
        z = 0
        x = 0
        y = 1
        z = x + y = 1
        x = y + z = 2
        y = x + z = 3
        z = x + y = 5
