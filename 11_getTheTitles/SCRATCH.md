Plan

Restate
    Take an array of books and authors and only return the book name.

Start with what you know
    The books are on the even numbers, 0, 2 so could find a way to filter out the odd numbers.
    
Reduce
    Take the array and loop through it. If the array item number divided by 2 is 0 then add that item to a new array. 
    Return that new array. 

    Use array.filter to filter out elements in the array that when divided by 2 are greater than 1.
