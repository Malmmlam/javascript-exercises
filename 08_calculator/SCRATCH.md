Plan

Restate / divide
    1. Create a function that adds two numbers together. 
    2. Create a function that subtracts one number from another.
    3. Create a function that returns the sum of all the numbers in an array.
        Create a variable with a value of 0 and then loop through the array adding each number to this variable
    4. create a function that returns the product of two numbers.
    5. create a function that returns the product of all numbers in an array.
        create a variable and assign it the value of the first number in the array. Loop through the array, starting with the second number, and multiply the numbers with the number in the variable. The variables value should be updated after every multiplication. 
    6. create a function that raises one number to the power of another.
    7. create a function that returns the factorial for a number. 
        create a variable with a value of 1. Create a loop that repeats until it reaches the value of the given parameter. Each time it loops it multiplies the value of the variable by an i value that increases by 1 each time and stores that value in the new variable.
